- Allocation (pie & bar charts)
- Top/worst performers

‚úÖ AI-powered insights:
- Detects overexposure to sectors/countries
- Suggests diversification opportunities
- Highlights unusual risks

‚úÖ Risk lens:
- Heatmaps of sector & geography exposure
- Basic volatility/risk metrics

‚úÖ Authentication (Google or magic link)

## üîó Sample APIs
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | /holdings/ | Add/update user holdings |
| GET | /holdings/ | Fetch portfolio |
| POST | /insights/ | Run AI analysis |
| GET | /risk/ | Get risk breakdown |

- A risk summary
- 3 actionable suggestions to improve diversification or risk
- Highlight any unusual concentration

Keep it professional yet simple. Avoid jargon.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Notes
- Use Alembic for DB migrations.
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM with async session if desired.
- Use environment variables for secrets & API keys.
- Use pgvector if implementing RAG in the future.
- Write modular & testable services in /services/.

## üìà Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)
- Broker & wallet integrations via APIs (Plaid/Yodlee/Coinbase)
- Scenario simulation: "What if S&P drops 10%?"
- Alerts & notifications
- API for developers to programmatically access insights

Mohamed Ben Taher (owner & developer)

## üëã Notes for Copilot
- Prefer async-friendly libraries where possible.
- Follow PEP8 & type hints.
- Keep API responses JSON, use Pydantic schemas for validation.
- Prioritize readability & maintainability.
